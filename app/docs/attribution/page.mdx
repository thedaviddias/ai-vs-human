# AI Attribution

To ensure that code generated by AI tools is correctly identified and attributed to AI, we rely on specific markers in commit messages, author names, and PR metadata.

Most modern AI coding tools have built-in support for attribution. Here is how to configure them.

---

## Cursor

Cursor, by default, automatically add attribution to every commit it makes. Here is how to ensure it's enabled for you.

### Enable Attribution in Settings

1. Open **Cursor Settings** (`Cmd + Shift + J` or `Ctrl + Shift + J`).
2. Go to **Agents** scroll the page to the bottom until **Attribution**.
3. Ensure **"Commit Attribution"** and **PR Attribution** are toggled **ON**.

When enabled, Cursor will append `Generated with Cursor` or `Co-authored-by: Cursor <cursoragent@cursor.com>` to its commits, allowing our engine to detect it accurately.

## Claude Code

Claude Code is Anthropic's command-line interface for coding. It includes attribution by default.

But if you want to be sure, add the attribution to your settings file:

Location: _~/.claude/settings.json_ or _.claude/settings.json_

```json
{
  "attribution": {
    "commits": true,
    "pullRequests": true
  }
}
```

***Options***:

- _commits_: Include Co-Authored-By in commit messages (default: true)
- _pullRequests_: Include Claude Code footer in PR descriptions (default: true)

### How it works

Every commit created by Claude Code includes a marker in the commit message:
`Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`

Pull-requests will include `Generated with [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)` at the end of the description.

## GitHub Copilot

GitHub Copilot is integrated into many IDEs. Depending on how you use it, attribution may vary.

### Copilot Extensions & Agents

If you use Copilot via a specialized extension or agent (like Copilot SWE Agent), it often includes a `Co-authored-by: GitHub Copilot` trailer. These are detected automatically.

---

## Manual Attribution

If your tool of choice doesn't support automatic attribution, or if you want to manually mark a specific commit as AI-assisted, you can use any of the following markers in your commit message:

### 1. Co-authored-by Trailer (Recommended)

Add this line at the bottom of your commit message:
`Co-authored-by: AI <ai@example.com>`

Our engine specifically looks for `Co-authored-by` trailers containing "AI", "Claude", "Copilot", "Cursor", etc.

### 2. Commit Message Keywords

Include any of these phrases in your commit message:
- `AI-generated`
- `Generated by AI`
- `[AI]`

---

## Why Attribution Matters

Correct attribution ensures that your project's dashboard accurately reflects the balance between human craftsmanship and AI assistance. It helps maintain transparency in open-source contributions and provides a realistic view of how AI tools are being integrated into your workflow.

## Rollout Note

Detection patterns improve over time, but updates apply when repositories are analyzed again.  
If a repository was indexed before a detection update, run a new analysis to pick up the latest attribution improvements.

If you use a tool that isn't being detected, please [open an issue](https://github.com/thedaviddias/bot-vs-human/issues) or [contribute a pattern](https://github.com/thedaviddias/bot-vs-human/blob/main/convex/classification/knownBots.ts) to our open-source detection engine.
